Taste good?

Are you alright?

10
00:04:35.813 --> 00:04:36.646
Take it and go to see the doctor

00:04:36.646 --> 00:04:37.686
Thanks

12
00:04:49.563 --> 00:04:50.563
Can you read it?

13
00:04:52.521 --> 00:04:53.151
What?

14
00:04:54.313 --> 00:04:55.523
Don't pretend

15
00:05:09.105 --> 00:05:10.975
How are you!

16
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:11.770

00:05:18.105 --> 00:05:19.015
That's it!

19
00:05:24.396 --> 00:05:27.016
That's great, first class

20
00:05:41.396 --> 00:05:43.396
Why don't we go out for a drink sometimes

21
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.900
It's pleasure doing business with you

22
00:06:09.897 --> 00:06:10.727
Good!

23
00:06:10.938 --> 00:06:12.558
Your English is improved

24
00:06:12.563 --> 00:06:14.396

Good morning, Mr Sung

Good morning, Mark

That's good

31
00:06:34.313 --> 00:06:35.023
Mr Yiu

32
00:06:35.313 --> 00:06:37.903
Ho, you are back! Everything OK?

33
00:06:38.146 --> 00:06:39.056
I counted already

34
00:06:39.062 --> 00:06:39.897
Clever

35
00:06:39.897 --> 00:06:41.057
Those foreigners are easy going

36
00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:43.309
Not all of them are as good as they are

37
00:06:43.313 --> 00:06:46.063
Your weakness is too
easy to believe someone

38
00:06:47.022 --> 00:06:47.812
Thanks!

39
00:06:47.813 --> 00:06:49.443
You are Shing? Sit...

00:06:49.771 --> 00:06:51.441
No, thanks It's better for me to stand

41
00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:57.689
Good morning. Linda!

42
00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:05.149
Rose!

43
00:07:06.563 --> 00:07:09.396
There's a lot, you can learn from Ho

44
00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:11.056
He's excellent

45
00:07:11.354 --> 00:07:15.024
But I'll never be as good as him

46
00:07:16.688 --> 00:07:18.478
Though mark is frivolous

47
00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:19.769
But he is loyal

48
00:07:19.855 --> 00:07:21.595
Yes, he takes good care of me

49
00:07:22.021 --> 00:07:22.688
What are you talking about?

50
00:07:22.688 --> 00:07:24.308
Nothing Just talking about you!

51
00:07:24.813 --> 00:07:25.483
Really?

52
00:07:27.021 --> 00:07:29.101
Your brother, Kit, graduates today

53
00:07:30.313 --> 00:07:33.903
Oh! Yes! I forgot to buy him a present

54
00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:35.189
I've got to go now

55
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:41.481
Ho. Take Shing with you tomorrow to Taiwan

56
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.560
Give the kid a chance

57
00:07:46.813 --> 00:07:48.521
Taiwan
Don't mistake it with Chai Wan?

58
00:07:48.521 --> 00:07:50.979
Though I've been in this field for years
I'm still afraid to go

59
00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:51.479
Do you know why?

60
00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:53.019
Too much fighting

61
00:07:53.021 --> 00:07:54.231
and drink

62
00:07:54.771 --> 00:07:55.771
Don't fool him

63
00:07:55.771 --> 00:07:56.691
OK

64
00:07:56.897 --> 00:07:58.767
Give Kit a hooker for a graduation present

65
00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:01.436
I'm no good, but I want
him to be a good citizen

66
00:08:01.438 --> 00:08:02.438
But it's better to have a whore

67
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.230
I want to see him to be a Ph D

68
00:08:06.646 --> 00:08:07.936
Getting married

69
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:09.979
And having his own baby

70
00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:11.479
Then you'll be as busy as a buffalo

71
00:08:14.438 --> 00:08:15.937
People say, one will step on shit

72
00:08:15.937 --> 00:08:17.437
with a big mouth

73
00:08:17.605 --> 00:08:18.515
You go in first

74
00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:21.599
You first

75
00:08:21.605 --> 00:08:23.015
I won't

76
00:08:24.354 --> 00:08:25.734
We will go in together

77
00:08:44.396 --> 00:08:45.436
Hold it. We are police

78
00:08:45.438 --> 00:08:46.268
Search!

79
00:08:46.271 --> 00:08:46.897
Sir

80
00:08:46.897 --> 00:08:47.597
Freeze

81
00:08:47.605 --> 00:08:48.475

82
00:08:48.479 --> 00:08:49.519
Don't turn around

83
00:08:50.104 --> 00:08:52.563
Both of us have guns
If you don't respect me...

84
00:08:52.563 --> 00:08:53.603
I won't

85
00:08:53.605 --> 00:08:55.185
See who doesn't respecting the others

86
00:09:01.146 --> 00:09:02.186
So ticklish

87
00:09:02.187 --> 00:09:03.517
Don't...

88
00:09:03.896 --> 00:09:04.806
Please...

89
00:09:04.813 --> 00:09:05.603
Are you sure?

90
00:09:05.979 --> 00:09:08.059
I have good news

91
00:09:08.062 --> 00:09:09.146
You'll surprise

92
00:09:09.146 --> 00:09:13.146
I am an Inspector, surprise!

93
00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:16.647
You have to work hard

94
00:09:16.937 --> 00:09:18.687
At least you've got to be a super intendant

95
00:09:19.979 --> 00:09:20.979
Jackie!

96
00:09:21.479 --> 00:09:22.309
She is my girlfriend

97
00:09:22.313 --> 00:09:23.483
She takes care of dad when she has time

98
00:09:24.021 --> 00:09:24.901
My brother

99
00:09:25.104 --> 00:09:25.944
Hi!

100
00:09:29.979 --> 00:09:31.599
Taking care of dad in this way!

101
00:09:36.896 --> 00:09:37.726
Thanks a lot

102
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:38.600
Don't mention it

103
00:09:38.813 --> 00:09:40.943
I've got to sit for an exam

104
00:09:42.396 --> 00:09:45.646
Are you going steady

105
00:09:46.104 --> 00:09:48.524
Don't know yet!

106
00:09:49.271 --> 00:09:52.311
You said you'll go with me! Hurry up!

107
00:09:53.479 --> 00:09:55.059
I really want to stay... But...

108
00:09:55.062 --> 00:09:56.688
No need to explain. Go!

109
00:09:56.688 --> 00:09:58.058
I go first

110
00:09:58.438 --> 00:09:59.228
Sorry

111
00:09:59.813 --> 00:10:00.730
Let's go!

112
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:01.600
Quick!

113
00:10:02.104 --> 00:10:02.904
Bye!

114
00:10:11.396 --> 00:10:12.306
Ho!

115
00:10:12.438 --> 00:10:13.148
Dad!

116
00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:15.596
You should quit

117
00:10:16.979 --> 00:10:19.309
Your brother doesn't know
what you have been doing

118
00:10:20.563 --> 00:10:22.483
Still remember

119
00:10:22.896 --> 00:10:24.516
You two played cop &
thief when you were kids

120
00:10:24.854 --> 00:10:26.104
He almost lost

121
00:10:27.104 --> 00:10:28.904
But he still wanted to be a cop

122
00:10:30.021 --> 00:10:31.851
I don't want you to play

123
00:10:31.854 --> 00:10:33.194
the same game again

124
00:10:35.062 --> 00:10:37.192
For your brother

125
00:10:40.062 --> 00:10:40.942
Promise!

126
00:10:42.896 --> 00:10:43.556
Yes!

127
00:10:55.563 --> 00:10:56.523
That's better

128
00:10:56.979 --> 00:10:58.688
Excuse me... Traffic is so bad

129
00:10:58.688 --> 00:11:00.018
Yes. Traffic jam

130
00:11:00.021 --> 00:11:00.561
- I am Jackie
- Sir

131
00:11:00.563 --> 00:11:02.063
- Traffic jam
- Give me a chance

132
00:11:02.187 --> 00:11:03.307
Please give her a chance

133
00:11:04.104 --> 00:11:06.438
Are you alright?

134
00:11:06.438 --> 00:11:07.268
I'm fine

135
00:11:07.271 --> 00:11:08.770
Sir, the traffic is really bad

136
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.520
Give her a chance please?

137
00:11:10.563 --> 00:11:11.229
OK...

138
00:11:11.229 --> 00:11:13.059
Go!

139
00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:21.229
So pity

140
00:11:21.229 --> 00:11:23.649
Listen. Judges

141
00:11:55.688 --> 00:11:56.478
Sorry

142
00:12:01.646 --> 00:12:03.846
It's you... You made me so embarrassed

143
00:12:04.229 --> 00:12:05.729
You spoiled everything

144
00:12:06.187 --> 00:12:07.146
How can I help you,

145
00:12:07.146 --> 00:12:08.556
if you don't have confidence yourself?

146
00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:10.059
They didn't say you are out

147
00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:11.192
How do you know you'll fail?

148
00:12:11.521 --> 00:12:12.731
Give it back to me

149
00:12:16.688 --> 00:12:18.808
I will really fail this time

150
00:12:29.479 --> 00:12:30.309
Are you sure?

151
00:12:31.605 --> 00:12:34.185
This will be my last time

152
00:12:39.271 --> 00:12:40.351
Because of Kit?

153
00:12:46.646 --> 00:12:49.146
Don't come with me to Taiwan tomorrow

154
00:12:49.354 --> 00:12:52.104
Any goes wrong, you here to handle it

155
00:12:53.896 --> 00:12:55.476
Then they will follow you

156
00:12:59.605 --> 00:13:00.725
I can't do it

157
00:13:02.479 --> 00:13:04.019
Then Shing will do it

158
00:13:04.479 --> 00:13:05.896
He resembles Albert Gino

159
00:13:05.896 --> 00:13:07.266
Please don't fool me, Mark

160
00:13:08.605 --> 00:13:10.685
Ho, we can't do without you

161
00:13:10.937 --> 00:13:12.637
I'm not mature yet

162
00:13:12.645 --> 00:13:13.935
Don't expect too much

163
00:13:15.563 --> 00:13:17.353
Don't think you can be the Big Brother

164
00:13:17.354 --> 00:13:18.604
by reading the books about underworld

165
00:13:21.271 --> 00:13:23.061
Anyone ever point a gun at you?

166
00:13:24.645 --> 00:13:25.595
No!

167
00:13:27.229 --> 00:13:28.349
12 years ago...

168
00:13:30.396 --> 00:13:31.476
12 years,

169
00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:35.731
Ho and I went to Indonesia the first time

170
00:13:37.479 --> 00:13:39.769
We had a dinner at a club
with their Big Brother

171
00:13:42.812 --> 00:13:44.852
I said something wrong

172
00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:47.021
Suddenly 2 guns were pointing at my head

173
00:13:48.645 --> 00:13:50.055
and I was ordered to
drink a bottle of whisky

174
00:13:52.896 --> 00:13:55.636
I was so scared

175
00:13:58.563 --> 00:13:59.443
Ho is really great

176
00:14:00.104 --> 00:14:01.354
He drank it for me

177
00:14:03.896 --> 00:14:05.976
But there was even worse

178
00:14:05.979 --> 00:14:07.639
4 guns were pointing at me then...

179
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:13.941
Do you know what they asked me to drink?

180
00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:16.274
Urine!

181
00:14:20.438 --> 00:14:21.938
Drank urine in the club

182
00:14:35.562 --> 00:14:37.812
Learning! That's what you call learning

183
00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:51.191
That's our first deal

184
00:14:52.187 --> 00:14:54.897
That's history! Don't talk about it anymore

185
00:14:55.271 --> 00:14:55.981
No!

186
00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:05.444
Never cried since I was a kid

187
00:15:09.604 --> 00:15:11.194
That's the first time I cried

188
00:15:14.979 --> 00:15:16.229
I swore that

189
00:15:16.229 --> 00:15:18.149
no one would ever point a gun at me again

190
00:15:43.479 --> 00:15:44.189
That's good!

191
00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.310
Be careful

192
00:15:57.104 --> 00:15:58.444
Hitting a sand bag more often

193
00:16:01.396 --> 00:16:02.396
I've to go tomorrow

194
00:16:07.104 --> 00:16:08.404
Regular disappear

195
00:16:10.062 --> 00:16:11.152
I'll be back soon

196
00:16:13.187 --> 00:16:16.227
When I'm away, take care of dad

197
00:16:16.979 --> 00:16:17.809
I will

198
00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:21.346
Take care!

199
00:16:22.354 --> 00:16:23.274
Yes!

200
00:17:11.354 --> 00:17:13.314
They're coming

201
00:17:17.229 --> 00:17:19.439
Be careful, there's something wrong here

202
00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:22.311
How do you know?

203
00:17:22.896 --> 00:17:23.556
Intuition

204
00:17:30.146 --> 00:17:32.476
Mr Sung, how are you!

205
00:17:32.478 --> 00:17:33.098
Where is Mr Wang?

206
00:17:33.104 --> 00:17:34.729
He's not feeling well I'm her nephew

207
00:17:34.729 --> 00:17:36.019
He asked me to replace him

208
00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:37.187
How are you!

209
00:17:37.187 --> 00:17:38.097
What kind of illness he has got?

210
00:17:39.021 --> 00:17:42.391
Mr Sung, let's in and talk

211
00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:43.515
Nothing serious

212
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.310
Just hiding out

213
00:17:45.313 --> 00:17:46.271
for a while

214
00:17:46.271 --> 00:17:47.851
Have a cup of tea

215
00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:49.191
Thanks!

216
00:17:49.437 --> 00:17:50.597
Mr Sung, this way please!

217
00:17:50.604 --> 00:17:53.062
Scared of everything
when you are getting old

218
00:17:53.062 --> 00:17:54.482
Please sit

219
00:17:54.687 --> 00:17:55.937
Don't waste time!

220
00:17:57.062 --> 00:17:57.937
Attention, head quarters

221
00:17:57.937 --> 00:18:01.227
Please check a car north town 1086379

222
00:18:01.229 --> 00:18:03.309
It's a bit suspicious

223
00:18:11.104 --> 00:18:12.604
We know you're reliable

224
00:18:12.604 --> 00:18:15.444
I respected you when I was a kid

225
00:18:16.146 --> 00:18:17.056
Do you believe that?

226
00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:19.770
Someone paid me double to kill you

227
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.560
He's crazy, who do they think I am?

228
00:18:22.937 --> 00:18:24.267
I give you money

229
00:18:44.478 --> 00:18:45.438
Police!

230
00:19:44.645 --> 00:19:45.265
Hello!

231
00:19:52.645 --> 00:19:53.345
Uncle

232
00:20:10.146 --> 00:20:12.736
We'll be miles away

233
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.896
Sung kill some of our men in Taiwan

234
00:20:27.896 --> 00:20:29.806
He is wanted by the Police

235
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.350
Big brother is worried that
Ho might talk his secret

236
00:20:32.812 --> 00:20:34.852
Please come with me

237
00:20:35.228 --> 00:20:36.848
I don't want to be rude

238
00:20:42.312 --> 00:20:43.392
You son of a bitch

239
00:20:43.395 --> 00:20:44.975
If you hurt my son

240
00:20:44.979 --> 00:20:46.309
I won't let you off

241
00:20:46.687 --> 00:20:48.187
Run!

242
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:48.896
What are you doing?

243
00:20:48.896 --> 00:20:50.306
No!

244
00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.600
Don't push me!

245
00:21:01.228 --> 00:21:02.268
Wrong number

246
00:21:09.228 --> 00:21:10.228
Go. Uncle!

247
00:21:14.645 --> 00:21:15.555
Uncle!

248
00:21:17.353 --> 00:21:18.693
Jackie, what's happening?

249
00:22:09.103 --> 00:22:10.813
Be careful, Kit?

250
00:22:10.979 --> 00:22:12.899
Dad, don't come out

251
00:22:47.021 --> 00:22:49.731
Dad, please don't

252
00:23:09.979 --> 00:23:10.939
Dad!

253
00:23:15.812 --> 00:23:21.772
Kit, you have to forgive your brother!

254
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.940
Who betrayed me?

255
00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:57.640
You?

256
00:23:58.103 --> 00:24:00.353
Ho, if I did

257
00:24:00.353 --> 00:24:02.103
I wouldn't be here with you now

258
00:24:08.395 --> 00:24:09.895
I don't know if I can escape this time

259
00:24:29.395 --> 00:24:32.015
Ho, what are you doing?

260
00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.310
I'm going to surrender

261
00:24:33.312 --> 00:24:34.437
You can't

262
00:24:34.437 --> 00:24:35.557
Please don't

263
00:24:35.562 --> 00:24:37.482
Please don't go

264
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:44.186
No

265
00:24:44.186 --> 00:24:45.096
Run!

266
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.270
Ho...

267
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.100
Go away

268
00:24:52.145 --> 00:24:53.515
I don't want to implicate another friend

269
00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.730
There's gun shots in the cavern

270
00:24:55.978 --> 00:24:56.848
You go

271
00:24:56.854 --> 00:24:57.729
No

272
00:24:57.729 --> 00:24:59.189
I insist you go

273
00:25:07.604 --> 00:25:10.812
Stand and don't move

274
00:25:10.812 --> 00:25:11.770
Put down the gun

275
00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:14.600
Did you hear me? Put down the gun

276
00:26:10.312 --> 00:26:13.232
There's no more rules in the world

277
00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:16.230
You can't trust any one today

278
00:26:17.061 --> 00:26:19.141
Even my nephew, Wang

279
00:26:19.645 --> 00:26:21.135
betrayed me

280
00:26:22.437 --> 00:26:24.267
He joined up with a new HK gang

281
00:26:25.395 --> 00:26:27.055
to try to take over my business

282
00:26:27.562 --> 00:26:31.022
As a result, we've lost Ho

283
00:26:34.395 --> 00:26:37.185
We respect a faithful man

284
00:26:37.562 --> 00:26:39.642
but not a traitor

285
00:26:42.812 --> 00:26:43.692
Hello!

286
00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:45.730
Yes!

287
00:26:48.895 --> 00:26:51.555
He will be in Fung Lim Restaurant tonight

288
00:26:55.812 --> 00:26:56.642
What are you gong to do?

289
00:26:57.103 --> 00:26:58.733
Do you need any help?

290
00:26:59.145 --> 00:27:00.595
Do you need my men?

291
00:27:07.228 --> 00:27:07.938
Take care!

292
00:27:09.228 --> 00:27:10.018
Thanks!

293
00:29:51.644 --> 00:29:52.103
Chief

294
00:29:52.103 --> 00:29:52.813
What's this?

295
00:29:53.728 --> 00:29:54.308
Chief

296
00:29:54.312 --> 00:29:55.192
Inside here

297
00:31:04.145 --> 00:31:05.935
I'm not scared

298
00:31:05.936 --> 00:31:08.886
My boss will post bail for me

299
00:31:08.895 --> 00:31:10.135
If you've the gut,

300
00:31:10.145 --> 00:31:11.225
fight with me without a gun

301
00:31:11.228 --> 00:31:13.058
See who is stronger?

302
00:31:16.186 --> 00:31:17.266
5703

303
00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.480
Sir, what's happening?

304
00:31:20.145 --> 00:31:20.805
Nothing!

305
00:31:30.437 --> 00:31:31.557
Sung, what's the charge?

306
00:31:32.395 --> 00:31:33.885
Drug trafficking, attacking the police

307
00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.020
How dare you insult Inspector Sung

308
00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.020
Take down his statement

309
00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.440
Thanks!

310
00:31:55.145 --> 00:31:58.515
How's that? Feeling different!

311
00:31:59.728 --> 00:32:00.478
Can I give you a lift?

312
00:32:00.895 --> 00:32:02.685
No, thanks We are not going the same way

313
00:32:04.145 --> 00:32:05.225
I admire you

314
00:32:05.811 --> 00:32:06.686
Because of your friends

315
00:32:06.686 --> 00:32:08.516
You kept quiet

316
00:32:09.728 --> 00:32:11.558
That's ridiculous You were behind bars

317
00:32:11.561 --> 00:32:13.981
The counterfeiting
racket is still strong

318
00:32:15.437 --> 00:32:16.227
Thanks!

319
00:32:18.895 --> 00:32:20.435
I'm not involved anymore

320
00:32:25.895 --> 00:32:27.305
Tell your friends

321
00:32:27.853 --> 00:32:29.643
The case is still open

322
00:32:30.061 --> 00:32:31.191
I won't let him off

323
00:32:34.186 --> 00:32:35.476
A bad guy for a day

324
00:32:35.477 --> 00:32:37.057
Will never be a good guy again

325
00:32:40.728 --> 00:32:41.558
Bye!

326
00:32:42.978 --> 00:32:44.228
I'll never come back again

327
00:33:30.436 --> 00:33:31.136
Stop!

328
00:34:01.394 --> 00:34:03.144
Kit, cool down

329
00:34:11.393 --> 00:34:12.603
Stop fighting

330
00:34:22.686 --> 00:34:24.096
Kit, stop

331
00:34:27.518 --> 00:34:28.808
Don't let me see you again

332
00:35:26.603 --> 00:35:27.353
Manager!

333
00:35:32.978 --> 00:35:34.348
There's no manager here

334
00:35:34.561 --> 00:35:36.231
I'm Ken, are you looking for me?

335
00:35:37.769 --> 00:35:41.349
Uncle Chung, asked me to come see you

336
00:35:41.644 --> 00:35:42.978
When I was doing business in Taiwan...

337
00:35:42.978 --> 00:35:45.478
Doing business? You were in jail!

338
00:35:49.061 --> 00:35:51.351
Mr Chung asked me to give you this letter

339
00:35:54.311 --> 00:35:56.731
Chung, he never does anything good

340
00:35:57.145 --> 00:35:59.135
But we are friends

341
00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.480
It's so difficult to get
a job for an ex-con

342
00:36:03.978 --> 00:36:05.558
No one will hire an ex-con

343
00:36:10.394 --> 00:36:11.604
Don't feel depressed

344
00:36:12.436 --> 00:36:15.556
All these guys were prisoner before

345
00:36:19.561 --> 00:36:21.061
Some people like to adopt orphans,

346
00:36:21.769 --> 00:36:23.559
I like to take care of ex-cons

347
00:36:25.145 --> 00:36:28.185
Because I was in prison too

348
00:36:32.603 --> 00:36:36.186
Everybody, here's a new man

349
00:36:36.186 --> 00:36:37.386
Take care of him

350
00:36:37.603 --> 00:36:39.686
He is... you are...

351
00:36:39.686 --> 00:36:40.766
Sung Tse Ho

352
00:36:41.269 --> 00:36:41.849
Ho brother!

353
00:36:42.895 --> 00:36:45.765
Just call me Ho

354
00:36:47.352 --> 00:36:49.522
Social gathering?

355
00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.100
Back to work

356
00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.190
I'm not paying you for doing nothing

357
00:36:55.477 --> 00:36:56.307
Do you have a driving license?

358
00:36:56.311 --> 00:36:56.981
No

359
00:36:57.853 --> 00:37:00.227
Whether you pass the exam or not...

360
00:37:00.227 --> 00:37:01.767
You can stay

361
00:37:02.519 --> 00:37:04.019
Thanks, Ken

362
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:07.560
Don't mention it There's no Boss here

363
00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.730
- Take it for lunch
- Thanks

364
00:39:09.394 --> 00:39:10.144
Mark!

365
00:39:21.227 --> 00:39:24.387
That's not what you told me in your letter

366
00:39:56.144 --> 00:39:57.564
Even I break my legs,

367
00:39:58.561 --> 00:39:59.811
I can't pay you back

368
00:40:01.561 --> 00:40:06.441
It's not your fault

369
00:40:12.978 --> 00:40:14.178
I'm so glad to see you again

370
00:40:15.895 --> 00:40:17.015
Haven't seen you for so long

371
00:40:18.019 --> 00:40:19.519
You're still looking the same

372
00:40:23.144 --> 00:40:26.894
Mark. This isn't our world anymore

373
00:40:27.811 --> 00:40:29.101
Why are you still here?

374
00:40:39.644 --> 00:40:43.144
I've waited for you for 3 years

375
00:40:47.936 --> 00:40:49.226
Let's start all over again

376
00:41:09.185 --> 00:41:13.935
Don't bother me Pay
attention to your brother

377
00:41:17.436 --> 00:41:20.136
He's following Shing everyday
That's very dangerous

378
00:41:25.394 --> 00:41:26.734
You're brothers

379
00:41:33.436 --> 00:41:36.016
Kit, we all know you are good at your work

380
00:41:37.227 --> 00:41:38.687
I recommended your promotion,

381
00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.350
but it's rejected

382
00:41:41.686 --> 00:41:42.556
Why?

383
00:41:50.603 --> 00:41:52.523
This guy, you know him very well

384
00:41:56.853 --> 00:41:58.353
He disappeared 3 years ago

385
00:41:59.227 --> 00:42:00.927
He's back after being released
from prison in Taiwan

386
00:42:01.853 --> 00:42:03.393
and got back with his old partners again

387
00:42:03.853 --> 00:42:04.893
It's none of my business

388
00:42:05.561 --> 00:42:06.769
We're investigating

389
00:42:06.769 --> 00:42:08.309
underworld activities

390
00:42:08.811 --> 00:42:09.728
and none of their family members

391
00:42:09.728 --> 00:42:11.848
would be related

392
00:42:13.144 --> 00:42:14.104
Understand?

393
00:42:18.603 --> 00:42:19.853
When I carry out my order

394
00:42:20.977 --> 00:42:22.767
I've never thought of my brother

395
00:42:24.561 --> 00:42:25.391
Kit!

396
00:42:26.728 --> 00:42:28.978
You're not in Shing's case anymore

397
00:42:29.477 --> 00:42:30.767
Or you'll spoil the whole matter

398
00:42:38.185 --> 00:42:39.845
Sung, Shing will meet those Thai tonight...

399
00:42:39.853 --> 00:42:40.643
Nam!

400
00:42:50.519 --> 00:42:52.519
Bottom up

401
00:42:53.185 --> 00:42:53.635
Mark

402
00:42:53.644 --> 00:42:54.394
Tell us about your stories

403
00:42:54.394 --> 00:42:55.519
Let Ho say it

404
00:42:55.519 --> 00:42:56.309
My boss says

405
00:42:56.311 --> 00:42:58.271
$18,000,000 maximum

406
00:42:58.811 --> 00:42:59.691
OK

407
00:42:59.769 --> 00:43:01.059
Boss, Ho is outside

408
00:43:04.977 --> 00:43:05.887
Draught beer, please

409
00:43:13.477 --> 00:43:15.387
This way please

410
00:43:22.394 --> 00:43:23.104
Ho!

411
00:43:23.436 --> 00:43:25.176
How come you didn't inform us you're back

412
00:43:25.185 --> 00:43:26.225
You shouldn't do that

413
00:43:30.977 --> 00:43:32.387
We were good brothers once

414
00:43:32.394 --> 00:43:33.234
Is that right, Mark?

415
00:43:39.102 --> 00:43:41.269
Ho, if you didn't take care of me

416
00:43:41.269 --> 00:43:42.559
I would never have what I have now

417
00:43:43.852 --> 00:43:44.892
Oh no

418
00:43:46.019 --> 00:43:48.599
You deserve it

419
00:43:48.603 --> 00:43:49.693
I don't have the ability

420
00:43:49.935 --> 00:43:51.345
It's Mark who gave me the chance

421
00:43:52.769 --> 00:43:54.439
Mark, if you need my help in the future

422
00:43:54.894 --> 00:43:55.814
Just say so

423
00:43:55.935 --> 00:43:58.475
Don't bullshit Let's drink

424
00:43:58.477 --> 00:43:59.977
You have to take care of our brothers

425
00:44:01.894 --> 00:44:03.314
Cheers!

426
00:44:07.644 --> 00:44:10.734
This is for my leg

427
00:44:13.394 --> 00:44:14.184
Happy

428
00:44:24.185 --> 00:44:26.175
Come to see me when you're free

429
00:44:26.394 --> 00:44:27.484
There's a lot we can talk

430
00:44:27.728 --> 00:44:28.598
I'm not interested

431
00:44:29.644 --> 00:44:30.694
You will be

432
00:44:32.019 --> 00:44:33.179
I have to go

433
00:44:41.603 --> 00:44:42.393
Sung Tse Ho!

434
00:44:45.311 --> 00:44:45.981
Follow me

435
00:44:59.019 --> 00:45:00.059
What are you doing?

436
00:45:03.019 --> 00:45:04.099
What did Shing tell you?

437
00:45:05.269 --> 00:45:05.929
Bullshit!

438
00:45:06.727 --> 00:45:07.887
Don't fool me!

439
00:45:08.144 --> 00:45:09.934
Business or bullshit?

440
00:45:10.561 --> 00:45:11.481
Bullshit, really

441
00:45:11.852 --> 00:45:13.062
Is there something arriving the day after?

442
00:45:13.519 --> 00:45:14.099
Don't know

443
00:45:14.352 --> 00:45:16.142
Where to load and when?

444
00:45:16.935 --> 00:45:17.595
Don't know

445
00:45:19.436 --> 00:45:21.516
How can you be a Big
Brother knowing nothing?

446
00:45:23.977 --> 00:45:24.687
Kit!

447
00:45:25.894 --> 00:45:28.394
Don't call me Kit, call me inspector!

448
00:45:37.727 --> 00:45:43.177
I'm not a Big Brother anymore

449
00:45:51.727 --> 00:45:52.597
Where do you work?

450
00:45:54.102 --> 00:45:55.522
United Taxi Co

451
00:45:57.727 --> 00:45:58.727
Decent business

452
00:46:02.519 --> 00:46:03.639
Robbing with a taxi?

453
00:46:06.727 --> 00:46:07.637
Where do you live?

454
00:46:08.144 --> 00:46:09.644
United Taxi Co

455
00:46:11.894 --> 00:46:13.524
Someone still accepted you thief

456
00:46:15.894 --> 00:46:18.352
Thief... Doesn't he have a name?

457
00:46:18.352 --> 00:46:19.977
Don't think you are great to have a gun

458
00:46:19.977 --> 00:46:21.637
I'll shoot you down, cripple

459
00:46:25.685 --> 00:46:28.555
Don't point at my head with a gun

460
00:46:29.185 --> 00:46:30.675
If you've got the guts,

461
00:46:31.477 --> 00:46:33.307
then shoot me...

462
00:46:34.727 --> 00:46:35.437
Kit!

463
00:46:36.185 --> 00:46:39.345
Sir, I know I owe you too much

464
00:46:39.977 --> 00:46:41.557
Give me a chance!

465
00:46:42.311 --> 00:46:43.231
Give you a chance?

466
00:46:43.852 --> 00:46:45.602
I beg you to give me one!

467
00:46:47.477 --> 00:46:48.557
Do you know because of you

468
00:46:48.894 --> 00:46:50.394
I lost my chance of promotion

469
00:46:51.394 --> 00:46:52.894
Because you are an agent of the underworld

470
00:46:58.269 --> 00:46:59.599
Don't leave HK

471
00:47:04.727 --> 00:47:06.137
I'll be back to get you

472
00:47:59.394 --> 00:48:01.274
Do you need an invitation for a cup of tea

473
00:48:01.643 --> 00:48:03.643
Thanks!

474
00:48:03.643 --> 00:48:05.773
I will deduct it from your salary

475
00:48:05.935 --> 00:48:07.175
You are mean

476
00:48:07.185 --> 00:48:08.765
Otherwise How can I support my family?

477
00:48:08.768 --> 00:48:09.808
You're right

478
00:48:12.519 --> 00:48:16.227
There's a beautiful girl staring at you

479
00:48:16.227 --> 00:48:17.637
Your girlfriend?

480
00:48:24.727 --> 00:48:25.597
Please come in!

481
00:48:26.269 --> 00:48:27.229
No!

482
00:48:29.436 --> 00:48:30.676
I want your help

483
00:48:33.269 --> 00:48:34.769
Can you leave HK for a while?

484
00:48:37.185 --> 00:48:39.305
I don't want to see Kit getting mad

485
00:48:39.311 --> 00:48:43.481
He can't take this pressure, neither can I

486
00:48:46.144 --> 00:48:49.564
So I think it's better for
you to be away for a while

487
00:48:50.311 --> 00:48:51.351
I won't leave!

488
00:48:54.185 --> 00:48:57.635
I want Kit to see that I'm in my new life

489
00:48:58.436 --> 00:48:59.676
Can you give me a chance

490
00:48:59.685 --> 00:49:01.225
to show it to him?

491
00:49:07.602 --> 00:49:09.352
Don't you see I want to skate

492
00:49:10.352 --> 00:49:12.642
Riding bicycle with him too?

493
00:49:14.102 --> 00:49:15.352
I don't want to lose this brother

494
00:49:23.394 --> 00:49:24.934
Ho!

495
00:49:26.727 --> 00:49:28.637
Don't stay here, go in!

496
00:49:29.685 --> 00:49:30.975
There's no use just staying here

497
00:49:31.894 --> 00:49:34.104
Ho can handle his own matter, go in!

498
00:49:37.977 --> 00:49:39.017
Who are they?

499
00:49:39.935 --> 00:49:40.925
They're not good

500
00:49:40.935 --> 00:49:42.805
Ho, Big Brother wants to see you

501
00:49:43.602 --> 00:49:44.442
I'm busy

502
00:49:45.019 --> 00:49:46.227
Give me some face

503
00:49:46.227 --> 00:49:47.677
Just come with me

504
00:49:52.436 --> 00:49:52.976
Hello!

505
00:49:52.977 --> 00:49:54.847
Ho, Mark is with us

506
00:49:54.852 --> 00:49:56.232
Come over too

507
00:49:56.894 --> 00:49:59.234
No, thanks I am not interested...

508
00:49:59.852 --> 00:50:01.682
You may not interested in business

509
00:50:01.685 --> 00:50:03.015
How about your brother?

510
00:50:03.019 --> 00:50:03.889
Doesn't it raise your interest?

511
00:50:04.144 --> 00:50:05.354
I'll wait for you!

512
00:50:06.476 --> 00:50:07.136
OK!

513
00:50:08.894 --> 00:50:09.984
Ken, I want to go out for a while

514
00:50:12.102 --> 00:50:13.682
You have to have principle, don't be afraid

515
00:50:15.435 --> 00:50:16.305
Be straight!

516
00:50:19.935 --> 00:50:21.925
Ho, please!

517
00:50:25.102 --> 00:50:29.232
You'll never be cleaned once you
belong to the underworld

518
00:50:57.227 --> 00:50:58.807
Ho!

519
00:51:00.185 --> 00:51:02.475
Ho, so glad you're back

520
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.390
How are you, Mr Yiu?

521
00:51:05.144 --> 00:51:07.314
Fine, thanks

522
00:51:07.476 --> 00:51:08.976
Come, talk to Shing!

523
00:51:11.019 --> 00:51:12.059
Not you?

524
00:51:13.852 --> 00:51:15.432
It's the same as talking to Shing

525
00:51:15.894 --> 00:51:19.434
I'm too old to make decisions

526
00:51:20.768 --> 00:51:21.848
Ho, sit please

527
00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.770
We can make big money

528
00:51:26.185 --> 00:51:28.175
I really hope to cooperate with you again

529
00:51:29.852 --> 00:51:30.682
How?

530
00:51:31.144 --> 00:51:32.524
You're still our Big Brother

531
00:51:32.768 --> 00:51:34.518
Mark handles the trafficking of money

532
00:51:34.977 --> 00:51:38.847
I'll take care of the drugs,
make money for our company

533
00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.930
We need you to contact
the old clients

534
00:51:44.351 --> 00:51:45.731
You haven't got to the point yet

535
00:51:48.185 --> 00:51:50.265
With your brother's assistance

536
00:51:50.269 --> 00:51:51.479
That would be perfect!

537
00:51:52.518 --> 00:51:53.388
What else to have your

538
00:51:53.393 --> 00:51:55.143
own man in the police!

539
00:51:58.311 --> 00:52:00.181
Come, I have something to tell you

540
00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.020
How about if I don't accept?

541
00:52:14.768 --> 00:52:15.308
Ho

542
00:52:15.518 --> 00:52:17.678
I kept Mark because of you

543
00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:21.930
Your brother is following everything

544
00:52:22.602 --> 00:52:25.272
If it wasn't you, he's dead already!

545
00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:33.730
Shing, one is my brother
the other is my friend

546
00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.060
How would I walk out this door

547
00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:36.640
if I said yes?

548
00:52:38.643 --> 00:52:39.893
It doesn't matter for you insult me

549
00:52:40.393 --> 00:52:41.933
But not my friend

550
00:52:50.268 --> 00:52:51.928
If you hurt my brother

551
00:52:52.935 --> 00:52:54.345
You won't live long

552
00:53:25.518 --> 00:53:27.348
We've wanted Mark Lee

553
00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:28.930
for 3 years

554
00:53:29.393 --> 00:53:31.983
But we can't take him back legally

555
00:53:32.727 --> 00:53:33.557
Otherwise,

556
00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:36.520
we can control the syndicate

557
00:53:36.935 --> 00:53:38.305
The Roc Police Dept is
willing to give information

558
00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:40.850
to the Interpol to the Hong Kong Government

559
00:53:40.852 --> 00:53:43.226
The US Government has also taken action

560
00:53:43.226 --> 00:53:44.056
I see!

561
00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:46.270
We've some information recently

562
00:53:46.476 --> 00:53:50.056
in 2 days there'll be counterfeit
shipped to Taiwan

563
00:53:50.518 --> 00:53:51.978
and 500 kg heroin!

564
00:53:53.019 --> 00:53:54.889
Though I can't do this case myself

565
00:53:55.768 --> 00:53:56.928
I hope to see

566
00:53:56.935 --> 00:53:58.885
Mark and his men being charged

567
00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:08.350
Boss, Ho is too much

568
00:54:08.351 --> 00:54:09.231
Let's kill him

569
00:54:10.019 --> 00:54:12.729
Not necessary

570
00:54:23.393 --> 00:54:24.353
Do as we plan

571
00:54:34.351 --> 00:54:36.727
I gave you the money already

572
00:54:36.727 --> 00:54:38.677
Where do we load the thing?

573
00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:42.350
I'll give you the address

574
00:54:48.019 --> 00:54:48.849
Get in!

575
00:54:54.643 --> 00:54:55.563
Come back!

576
00:55:01.476 --> 00:55:02.476
Did you have dinner yet?

577
00:55:08.727 --> 00:55:09.637
What are you doing?

578
00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.350
Mr Mok, its Kit, I've got hints

579
00:55:46.351 --> 00:55:48.560
That Thai will deal with Shing tomorrow

580
00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.890
Time and location should be...

581
00:55:50.894 --> 00:55:52.854
OK, you hand in the hints tomorrow

582
00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:54.310
and there will be no concern of yours

583
00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:55.060
Why?

584
00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:56.518
You are not involved

585
00:55:56.518 --> 00:55:57.848
I'm afraid that you'll
spoil the whole thing

586
00:55:58.977 --> 00:56:00.267
Give me a chance?

587
00:56:00.268 --> 00:56:01.018
I have told you that

588
00:56:01.019 --> 00:56:02.679
There is no hero in the police

589
00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:03.850
What are you doing now?

590
00:56:31.059 --> 00:56:32.639
Do you know that today is my birthday?

591
00:57:00.602 --> 00:57:01.810
Can you look at me?

592
00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:03.059
You'll look

593
00:57:03.059 --> 00:57:04.559
at vase

594
00:57:04.935 --> 00:57:06.765
This is your home, not the police barrack

595
00:57:09.143 --> 00:57:12.233
You even forget my birthday

596
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:24.270
Jackie

597
00:57:30.852 --> 00:57:31.732
Happy birthday

598
00:57:35.727 --> 00:57:36.637
I didn't forget

599
00:57:50.226 --> 00:57:52.386
Blow out the candles

600
00:58:06.143 --> 00:58:07.018
What wish did you make?

601
00:58:07.018 --> 00:58:08.598
You really want to know?

602
00:58:08.727 --> 00:58:09.557
What is it?

603
00:58:10.143 --> 00:58:11.976
Promise not to lose your temper

604
00:58:11.976 --> 00:58:13.306
Say it

605
00:58:15.894 --> 00:58:18.064
The reunion of the two of you

606
00:58:26.143 --> 00:58:27.313
Don't be angry

607
00:58:27.976 --> 00:58:28.806
Nothing

608
00:58:29.934 --> 00:58:32.564
Don't get angry on my birthday

609
00:58:32.976 --> 00:58:34.516
I don't let you get angry

610
00:58:34.518 --> 00:58:36.518
Otherwise I will get angry

611
00:58:37.059 --> 00:58:37.979
Smile

612
00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:42.730
Let me open it

613
00:58:50.351 --> 00:58:51.231
Anything happens?

614
00:58:54.393 --> 00:58:55.683
I want to speak to Kit

615
00:59:01.351 --> 00:59:02.311
Who is?

616
00:59:03.143 --> 00:59:04.393
Don't be mad

617
00:59:04.393 --> 00:59:06.603
Keep your promise

618
00:59:20.184 --> 00:59:20.893
Sit

619
00:59:20.893 --> 00:59:21.643
Thanks

620
00:59:22.143 --> 00:59:23.683
Today is your birthday?

621
00:59:23.934 --> 00:59:24.644
Yes

622
00:59:25.226 --> 00:59:26.306
Have a piece of cake

623
00:59:26.310 --> 00:59:27.640
Why do you treat him that nice?

624
00:59:28.184 --> 00:59:29.984
Don't do that

625
00:59:32.727 --> 00:59:35.977
I don't care how you treat me

626
00:59:36.685 --> 00:59:38.675
I'm here to tell you that

627
00:59:38.976 --> 00:59:40.766
Shing tries to tramp you

628
00:59:41.101 --> 00:59:42.521
Be careful

629
00:59:43.143 --> 00:59:44.183
Thank you!

630
00:59:44.685 --> 00:59:46.055
Don't trust those crummy

631
00:59:47.268 --> 00:59:49.138
It's always a trick if you

632
00:59:49.934 --> 00:59:51.484
have it too easy

633
00:59:53.143 --> 00:59:55.143
Do you think I am as dumb as before?

634
00:59:55.435 --> 00:59:57.725
I only want to help you

635
00:59:57.727 --> 00:59:58.887
Help me or trick me?

636
01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:03.059
Do you know

637
01:00:03.059 --> 01:00:05.179
You are my burden

638
01:00:06.226 --> 01:00:07.766
Can you trust me one more time?

639
01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:11.850
Trust you?

640
01:00:18.393 --> 01:00:19.143
Jackie!

641
01:00:21.809 --> 01:00:22.599
Ho!

642
01:00:24.143 --> 01:00:27.313
He didn't change a bit on my impression

643
01:00:28.101 --> 01:00:31.059
Don't give up

644
01:00:31.059 --> 01:00:32.599
Don't let the other look down upon you

645
01:00:38.727 --> 01:00:40.427
Why can't you forgive him?

646
01:00:40.727 --> 01:00:42.017
Let him start a new life?

647
01:00:42.018 --> 01:00:43.768
He killed dad indirectly?

648
01:00:44.893 --> 01:00:46.433
Why do you force me to accept him

649
01:00:53.184 --> 01:00:54.684
He can't blame anymore for
choosing the wrong way?

650
01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:06.350
I'm the cop, he's the thief

651
01:01:09.059 --> 01:01:12.929
We're going opposite

652
01:01:56.351 --> 01:01:57.061
I'm a cop

653
01:02:07.976 --> 01:02:08.846
What's happening? Ken!

654
01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:11.426
Your brother is having an operation

655
01:02:13.143 --> 01:02:14.393
He's now in Queen Mary's

656
01:02:14.393 --> 01:02:15.433
Hurry up!

657
01:02:15.518 --> 01:02:16.228
OK

658
01:02:23.143 --> 01:02:24.483
What happened to my brother?

659
01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.020
He is being tricked by Shing

660
01:02:26.393 --> 01:02:27.393
He purposely did it

661
01:02:28.851 --> 01:02:29.731
How is he?

662
01:02:29.976 --> 01:02:31.266
You can't get in

663
01:03:12.059 --> 01:03:13.767
I tried to stop him alone

664
01:03:13.767 --> 01:03:14.927
But he insisted

665
01:03:15.476 --> 01:03:16.806
I hope you can cooperate with the police

666
01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:18.849
and let's know your location

667
01:04:09.851 --> 01:04:13.431
It's easy to be a hero. Jump

668
01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.180
It's not the same now, you
don't have any choice

669
01:04:19.226 --> 01:04:20.556
Get along with us

670
01:04:21.767 --> 01:04:23.177
And don't tell the police

671
01:04:23.642 --> 01:04:25.062
We know each other well

672
01:04:58.351 --> 01:05:00.641
What's happening?

673
01:05:06.184 --> 01:05:07.984
Don't use Sung ever again

674
01:05:14.726 --> 01:05:15.806
Stop!

675
01:05:27.976 --> 01:05:29.016
Fight with them

676
01:05:45.976 --> 01:05:46.726
Stop it!

677
01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:51.183
Can we make a deal

678
01:05:51.517 --> 01:05:52.807
It's not worthwhile

679
01:05:52.809 --> 01:05:54.179
breaking rules again

680
01:06:07.393 --> 01:06:08.433
Stop fighting

681
01:06:11.226 --> 01:06:12.766
Stop

682
01:06:16.226 --> 01:06:17.846
Run!

683
01:06:17.851 --> 01:06:20.641
You idiot, don't go!

684
01:06:22.726 --> 01:06:24.386
Stay if you have guts!

685
01:06:25.018 --> 01:06:26.138
You, son of bitch!

686
01:06:29.310 --> 01:06:30.520
Ken. That's my fault

687
01:06:31.184 --> 01:06:32.434
I don't want you to be involved

688
01:06:34.642 --> 01:06:36.182
You've no principle

689
01:06:36.601 --> 01:06:38.271
They fight because they are scared

690
01:06:39.018 --> 01:06:41.348
If you hit them back then they win

691
01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:49.639
Why do you want to change?

692
01:06:49.642 --> 01:06:50.682
Why?

693
01:06:51.184 --> 01:06:53.604
Who's he?

694
01:06:54.018 --> 01:06:55.428
Ken! Ho!

695
01:06:55.434 --> 01:06:56.434
Come and have a look

696
01:06:56.434 --> 01:06:57.524
Come over

697
01:06:57.601 --> 01:07:02.021
Mark...

698
01:07:04.642 --> 01:07:06.352
Emergency box

699
01:07:07.393 --> 01:07:08.603
Quick!

700
01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:15.270
Ken, what are we going to do?

701
01:07:17.642 --> 01:07:18.732
Let's go!

702
01:07:40.767 --> 01:07:42.557
Police. Stop for searching

703
01:07:46.517 --> 01:07:49.517
That's too much

704
01:07:49.517 --> 01:07:51.467
I'll send the quotation to the Station

705
01:07:51.642 --> 01:07:53.352
Smart

706
01:08:16.268 --> 01:08:19.428
I did notice the beauty of HK at night

707
01:08:22.725 --> 01:08:24.845
But it doesn't last

708
01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:26.770
It's not worthwhile

709
01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:35.100
Ho!

710
01:08:36.059 --> 01:08:37.179
Let's start all over again

711
01:08:38.059 --> 01:08:39.469
After this last time

712
01:08:39.475 --> 01:08:41.225
then leave HK

713
01:08:42.684 --> 01:08:43.225
Mark!

714
01:08:43.225 --> 01:08:45.265
We've never been scared before

715
01:08:45.975 --> 01:08:47.465
Why are we scared of Shing...

716
01:08:47.684 --> 01:08:50.774
Don't push me, I'll never
get involved again

717
01:08:56.392 --> 01:08:59.232
Those are memories

718
01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:02.020
I'm still alive

719
01:09:03.268 --> 01:09:06.138
Even you do 10 times, 100 times

720
01:09:06.143 --> 01:09:07.143
Then what?

721
01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:08.813
Even you kill Shing?

722
01:09:16.434 --> 01:09:17.684
I lost my brother already

723
01:09:18.143 --> 01:09:19.853
I don't want to lost you too

724
01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:23.180
- Mark, can you wake up?
- Don't say anything

725
01:09:24.767 --> 01:09:25.677
I don't want sympathy

726
01:09:28.893 --> 01:09:30.063
You didn't owe me anything?

727
01:09:31.143 --> 01:09:33.063
I never force my friend's
doing things unwillingly

728
01:09:34.184 --> 01:09:35.314
I've my principle

729
01:09:36.018 --> 01:09:37.808
I don't want to loose for my whole life

730
01:09:39.934 --> 01:09:41.184
Do you think I like begging?

731
01:09:43.684 --> 01:09:46.144
I've waited for a chance for 3 years

732
01:09:47.267 --> 01:09:48.057
I've to show them

733
01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:49.684
that I'm the best

734
01:09:49.934 --> 01:09:50.809
I just want to say that

735
01:09:50.809 --> 01:09:52.389
I take back my losses

736
01:10:02.767 --> 01:10:05.597
What did you look like?

737
01:10:07.392 --> 01:10:08.732
We were scared when we were bad

738
01:10:09.184 --> 01:10:12.224
Felt as if we were being
followed when we are good

739
01:10:13.143 --> 01:10:14.773
Did you fight for a chance?

740
01:10:16.143 --> 01:10:16.893
You didn't

741
01:10:17.934 --> 01:10:18.894
No!

742
01:10:23.767 --> 01:10:24.677
Same as you

743
01:10:29.642 --> 01:10:30.222
Mark!

744
01:11:00.018 --> 01:11:00.978
What happened to you?

745
01:11:02.267 --> 01:11:03.517
I just want to take back something

746
01:11:20.726 --> 01:11:21.516
Stand over that side

747
01:11:22.101 --> 01:11:22.891
Go and steal the plate

748
01:11:23.559 --> 01:11:25.849
You'll be in big trouble

749
01:11:26.976 --> 01:11:28.136
Think twice before you do it

750
01:11:35.142 --> 01:11:36.182
Stop for a moment

751
01:11:47.767 --> 01:11:48.637
Run!

752
01:11:48.893 --> 01:11:49.683
Open the door!

753
01:11:51.809 --> 01:11:52.639
Thanks. Mr Chan!

754
01:11:54.684 --> 01:11:55.394
Go after them

755
01:13:44.309 --> 01:13:45.639
You idiot!

756
01:13:46.267 --> 01:13:47.597
I told you that's too much

757
01:13:48.434 --> 01:13:49.274
Idiot

758
01:13:49.893 --> 01:13:52.851
If Ho hands the plate to the police

759
01:13:52.851 --> 01:13:53.811
Not only you will die but

760
01:13:54.183 --> 01:13:55.976
even the syndicate will collapse

761
01:13:55.976 --> 01:13:56.636
That's enough

762
01:13:56.642 --> 01:13:58.392
Don't call me idiot

763
01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:00.221
What did you call me when I gave you money?

764
01:14:00.475 --> 01:14:02.175
I regret to have you

765
01:14:02.809 --> 01:14:05.429
I'll kill you if you don't
bring me back the plate

766
01:14:05.684 --> 01:14:06.644
You kill me then

767
01:14:07.142 --> 01:14:08.852
I betrayed Ho 3 years ago

768
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:10.640
Would I be scared of him now?

769
01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.560
You have to pay him back

770
01:14:16.893 --> 01:14:17.973
We've to share

771
01:14:18.309 --> 01:14:19.559
the problem together!

772
01:14:26.601 --> 01:14:27.181
Hello!

773
01:14:29.183 --> 01:14:32.223
Ho, why did you give me such a problem?

774
01:14:32.225 --> 01:14:34.055
Mr Yiu. I want to speak to Shing

775
01:14:34.392 --> 01:14:36.852
Shing? Wait a minute

776
01:14:37.809 --> 01:14:39.058
Ask him to give

777
01:14:39.058 --> 01:14:41.428
us back the plate

778
01:14:44.225 --> 01:14:45.925
Ho, don't fool me

779
01:14:46.809 --> 01:14:48.219
We can compromise

780
01:14:48.434 --> 01:14:51.767
10pm tonight. Go to
Temple with US$2,000,000

781
01:14:51.767 --> 01:14:52.767
For the exchange of the plate

782
01:14:52.975 --> 01:14:55.015
and have a boat ready for you at The Bay

783
01:14:55.434 --> 01:14:56.354
That's simple?

784
01:14:56.517 --> 01:14:57.427
I want cash

785
01:14:58.559 --> 01:14:59.429
You yourself!

786
01:14:59.601 --> 01:15:00.391
I will be there

787
01:15:09.642 --> 01:15:11.062
What did Ho say?

788
01:15:11.893 --> 01:15:13.433
What did he say?

789
01:15:16.183 --> 01:15:16.933
What?

790
01:15:17.392 --> 01:15:18.892
He said he wants to have dinner with you

791
01:15:18.893 --> 01:15:20.433
OK, I'll wait for him

792
01:15:25.017 --> 01:15:27.307
Sir!

793
01:15:28.267 --> 01:15:29.057
Come in!

794
01:15:30.058 --> 01:15:31.428
Mr Mok, I've information

795
01:15:31.434 --> 01:15:33.601
Ho, Mark and Shing have a quarrel

796
01:15:33.601 --> 01:15:35.221
They blackmailed Shing

797
01:15:35.225 --> 01:15:36.465
and they're having a deal tonight

798
01:15:38.892 --> 01:15:40.142
Did you know the time and place?

799
01:15:40.142 --> 01:15:41.222
Later

800
01:15:43.058 --> 01:15:44.518
Hello. I'm...

801
01:15:46.892 --> 01:15:47.522
Thanks!

802
01:15:49.726 --> 01:15:50.676
2 minutes ago

803
01:15:50.684 --> 01:15:52.892
Shing debited US$2,000,000 from the bank

804
01:15:52.892 --> 01:15:54.182
Everyone get ready

805
01:15:54.183 --> 01:15:55.517
for order

806
01:15:55.517 --> 01:15:56.387
Yes, Sir!

807
01:15:57.225 --> 01:15:59.095
Mr Mok. Let me in

808
01:15:59.559 --> 01:16:00.726
You should be in the hospital

809
01:16:00.726 --> 01:16:01.596
What are you doing here?

810
01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:06.767
I'm fine

811
01:16:06.767 --> 01:16:08.057
You've a paid leave for a few days

812
01:16:10.267 --> 01:16:12.387
See, I can lift the chair easily

813
01:16:12.851 --> 01:16:13.891
You're not included

814
01:16:15.475 --> 01:16:17.265
My brother is the thief Not me

815
01:16:18.975 --> 01:16:20.095
Why do you

816
01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.140
give me pressure?

817
01:16:21.392 --> 01:16:22.350
If you still remember the rules

818
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:23.140
You shouldn't get involved

819
01:16:23.142 --> 01:16:24.222
My dad died 3 years ago

820
01:16:24.225 --> 01:16:25.555
I allow Shing

821
01:16:25.559 --> 01:16:26.679
But you two are brothers

822
01:16:26.684 --> 01:16:27.767
I know this case most thoroughly

823
01:16:27.767 --> 01:16:28.727
Don't depress me

824
01:16:28.767 --> 01:16:30.387
I want to lock him up myself

825
01:16:31.726 --> 01:16:34.346
I'll lock him up

826
01:16:37.017 --> 01:16:38.767
I'll

827
01:16:42.392 --> 01:16:44.892
Kit. Be practical

828
01:17:36.726 --> 01:17:37.386
Jackie

829
01:17:44.017 --> 01:17:45.467
I'm leaving HK tonight

830
01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:48.310
You are giving up

831
01:17:49.766 --> 01:17:50.466
Can you give

832
01:17:50.684 --> 01:17:51.892
this packet

833
01:17:51.892 --> 01:17:53.222
to Kit tonight at 9

834
01:17:54.017 --> 01:17:55.807
It's very important to him

835
01:18:00.225 --> 01:18:01.385
Will you come back?

836
01:18:20.892 --> 01:18:23.142
Kit, your brother is leaving tonight

837
01:18:23.392 --> 01:18:25.222
He asked me to give this packet to you

838
01:18:25.642 --> 01:18:28.472
Kit. The plate I gave you

839
01:18:28.933 --> 01:18:30.773
is the proof to charge Shing

840
01:18:31.684 --> 01:18:33.934
We're having a dealing tonight at The Bay

841
01:18:34.475 --> 01:18:36.965
You can put me in prison if you like to

842
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:39.270
I decided not to stay in HK

843
01:18:41.392 --> 01:18:43.472
What are you doing?

844
01:18:43.684 --> 01:18:44.524
I have to grab him

845
01:18:44.725 --> 01:18:46.345
No. You can't

846
01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:47.559
No

847
01:18:47.559 --> 01:18:48.679
Go away!

848
01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:53.925
Kit...

849
01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:07.140
Ho. They are late

850
01:19:12.142 --> 01:19:13.432
Do you know what to say?

851
01:19:41.017 --> 01:19:42.097
Do you believe in god?

852
01:19:44.183 --> 01:19:46.353
I'm the god

853
01:19:48.975 --> 01:19:50.175
God is a human

854
01:19:52.559 --> 01:19:54.519
Anyone will be god, if
he can control his life

855
01:19:56.434 --> 01:19:59.934
But sometimes you couldn't

856
01:20:03.725 --> 01:20:05.015
You'll either gain or loose

857
01:20:15.309 --> 01:20:16.219
Hold it!

858
01:20:19.517 --> 01:20:20.177
Money?

859
01:20:23.392 --> 01:20:24.272
Plate?

860
01:20:25.142 --> 01:20:26.222
Hand it to the police

861
01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:34.020
Don't

862
01:20:35.225 --> 01:20:36.595
There's a bomb

863
01:20:36.892 --> 01:20:38.272
I'm not a dummy

864
01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:44.520
You scared?

865
01:20:45.850 --> 01:20:47.270
Don't trick me?

866
01:21:22.058 --> 01:21:23.348
Shit!

867
01:21:27.142 --> 01:21:29.972
After Ho arrived, he had
a quarrel with Master

868
01:21:29.975 --> 01:21:31.715
He asked for $2,000,000

869
01:21:31.725 --> 01:21:33.385
He'll be at sea tonight

870
01:21:33.392 --> 01:21:34.892
Then I heard a shot

871
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:36.640
That's him

872
01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:38.430
Are you sure?

873
01:21:38.434 --> 01:21:39.394
Yes!

874
01:21:39.933 --> 01:21:40.893
Do you want to be the witness?

875
01:21:41.475 --> 01:21:42.305
Yes!

876
01:22:19.183 --> 01:22:20.353
I know you'll do that already

877
01:22:21.142 --> 01:22:21.932
You'll lose

878
01:22:22.475 --> 01:22:23.055
Get out!

879
01:22:24.392 --> 01:22:27.102
Get out...

880
01:22:28.641 --> 01:22:29.771
If you're better, release him!

881
01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:34.720
Come over

882
01:22:36.017 --> 01:22:36.597
Go!

883
01:22:57.267 --> 01:22:58.467
Ho, on board

884
01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.270
You go first

885
01:23:02.975 --> 01:23:04.265
You said we'll go together

886
01:23:06.558 --> 01:23:07.638
I've something to do

887
01:23:12.267 --> 01:23:13.427
I'll meet you

888
01:23:16.683 --> 01:23:18.973
Mark. Go!

889
01:23:24.350 --> 01:23:25.430
I'll wait for you

890
01:24:32.725 --> 01:24:33.595
Release him

891
01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.850
Otherwise, I'll kill your brother

892
01:24:35.516 --> 01:24:36.636
Don't do it

893
01:24:39.474 --> 01:24:40.434
One for each

894
01:24:48.349 --> 01:24:52.639
Go!

895
01:25:11.474 --> 01:25:12.434
I won't let you off

896
01:25:14.474 --> 01:25:15.354
I know!

897
01:25:28.474 --> 01:25:31.104
Kit!

898
01:27:39.142 --> 01:27:40.022
Come over

899
01:29:25.933 --> 01:29:26.933
You

900
01:29:29.516 --> 01:29:32.056
Look at your brother

901
01:29:34.725 --> 01:29:36.095
Look!

902
01:29:40.516 --> 01:29:42.266
No matter how he wronged you before

903
01:29:42.266 --> 01:29:43.596
He paid you back now

904
01:29:49.433 --> 01:29:50.603
He has the guts to change

905
01:29:51.558 --> 01:29:53.058
What can't you forgive him?

906
01:29:53.516 --> 01:29:54.266
Why?

907
01:30:00.349 --> 01:30:01.179
For a brother...

908
01:30:49.141 --> 01:30:51.471
Shing!

909
01:31:21.057 --> 01:31:22.677
You can't get over, Miss

910
01:31:25.141 --> 01:31:25.931
Shing!

911
01:31:31.974 --> 01:31:34.934
Ho, you're being surrounded

912
01:31:35.308 --> 01:31:36.848
In 3 minutes

913
01:31:36.850 --> 01:31:38.520
Come out unarmed

914
01:31:52.349 --> 01:31:53.269
No more bullets

915
01:31:55.558 --> 01:31:56.808
I'm going to surrender

916
01:31:57.558 --> 01:31:58.558
I'll be alright

917
01:31:59.016 --> 01:32:00.056
You'll not

918
01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:04.720
I will have money, 3 days later

919
01:32:04.725 --> 01:32:06.215
I'll be released

920
01:32:06.932 --> 01:32:09.392
I've money, can change black to white

921
01:32:10.850 --> 01:32:12.890
I learned it from you

922
01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:14.970
But your brother,

923
01:32:15.516 --> 01:32:17.716
because of you, he's from white to black

924
01:32:18.474 --> 01:32:19.564
You tramp him

925
01:33:30.141 --> 01:33:34.061
Kit. You didn't do it wrong

926
01:33:34.516 --> 01:33:35.846
We are on different routes

927
01:33:37.308 --> 01:33:39.678
Yours are right

928
01:33:47.974 --> 01:33:49.184
I was wrong before

929
01:33:51.558 --> 01:33:54.598
I want to be back on the right one now
